## ⚠️ Important Notes

### Backend Server NOT Included in Vercel Deployment
The Vercel deployment only includes the **frontend React app**. The FastAPI backend features (Model Comparison Dashboard, Benchmarking) will **NOT work** on Vercel without additional setup.

### What Works on Vercel:
✅ User signup/login
✅ Image Analysis (Gemini API directly from browser)
✅ Multi-Model Comparison (Gemini + Mock Models)
✅ Chat Consultation (Gemini API)
✅ Voice Consultation (Gemini API)
✅ PDF Download for all sections
✅ Responsive design

### What Requires Backend:
❌ Model Comparison Dashboard (separate page - requires backend API)
❌ Benchmarking Dashboard (requires backend API)
❌ Real multi-model evaluation (currently using mock data)

---

## 🔧 Full Stack Deployment Options

### Option 1: Separate Backend Hosting
**Frontend:** Vercel (current setup)
**Backend:** Deploy FastAPI to:
- Railway.app (recommended, free tier)
- Render.com (free tier)
- PythonAnywhere (free tier)
- Heroku (paid)

Then update frontend to point to backend URL.

### Option 2: All-in-One Platform
Deploy both frontend + backend to:
- Railway.app
- Render.com
- DigitalOcean App Platform

---

## 🎯 Quick Deploy to Railway (Full Stack)

### 1. Push Backend Separately
```bash
cd backend
git init
echo "node_modules/" > .gitignore
echo "venv/" >> .gitignore
echo "__pycache__/" >> .gitignore
git add .
git commit -m "Backend API"
git push
```

### 2. Deploy to Railway
1. Go to **https://railway.app**
2. Sign in with GitHub
3. New Project → Deploy from GitHub
4. Select backend repository
5. Add environment variables:
   - `PORT=8000`
   - `PYTHON_VERSION=3.11`

### 3. Update Frontend
In `src/services/*.ts` files, update API URLs:
```typescript
const API_URL = 'https://your-backend-url.railway.app/api/v1';
```

---

## 📦 Local Development

### Frontend
```bash
npm install
npm run dev
# Opens at http://localhost:5174
```

### Backend
```bash
cd backend
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate  # Windows
pip install -r requirements.txt
python main.py
# Runs at http://localhost:8000
```

## 🔐 Security Notes

### ⚠️ API Keys Exposed
Your API keys are currently:
- Hardcoded in `.env.example`
- Committed to GitHub (public repository)

### 🛡️ Security Best Practices:
1. **Rotate your API keys immediately** after deployment
2. Use Vercel Environment Variables (not committed to git)
3. Consider using backend proxy for API calls
4. Enable API key restrictions in Google Cloud Console

### To Rotate Keys:
1. **Gemini API**: https://aistudio.google.com/apikey
2. **DeepSeek API**: https://platform.deepseek.com/api_keys
