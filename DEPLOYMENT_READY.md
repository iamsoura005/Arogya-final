## ⚠️ Important Security Note

### Your API Keys Are Public!

Since the keys were committed to GitHub, they are now public. After deployment:

### ✅ IMMEDIATELY Rotate Keys:

1. **Gemini API Key**
   - Go to: https://aistudio.google.com/apikey
   - Delete old key
   - Create new key
   - Update in Vercel Environment Variables

2. **DeepSeek API Key**
   - Go to: https://platform.deepseek.com/api_keys
   - Revoke old key
   - Create new key
   - Update in Vercel Environment Variables

### After Rotating Keys:
1. Go to Vercel Dashboard → Your Project
2. Settings → Environment Variables
3. Edit each variable with new key
4. Redeploy (Vercel will do this automatically)

## 🎯 What Works on Vercel

### ✅ Fully Functional:

- Image Analysis (Gemini AI)
- Multi-Model Comparison (Gemini + 3 mock models)
- Chat Consultation

### ❌ Backend Not Deployed:
